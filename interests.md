## Quotes that I am inspired by:

#### On having a growth mindset
_Process­ praise acknowledges the effort; talent­ praise reinforces the notion that one only succeeds (or doesn’t) based on a fixed trait._ *- [Sal Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/talks-and-interviews/conversations-with-sal/a/the-learning-myth-why-ill-never-tell-my-son-hes-smart)*

#### On the sharing economy

_Markets are beginning to give way to networks, ownership is becoming less important than access, the pursuit of self-interest is being tempered by the pull of collaborative interests, and the traditional dream of rags to riches is being supplanted by a new dream of a sustainable quality of life. - [Jeremy Rifkin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18594514-the-zero-marginal-cost-society)_
